# 🏠 Airbnb Market Analysis – Tableau Project

## 📊 Project Overview

This Tableau dashboard project analyzes Airbnb listings to uncover key market insights such as pricing trends, location demand, property availability, and host performance. The goal is to help stakeholders (hosts, investors, and analysts) make data-driven decisions in the short-term rental market.

## 🧾 Objective

The main objectives of this project are to:

- Identify pricing trends based on location, room type, and seasonality.
- Evaluate host listing performance.
- Examine availability and booking patterns.
- Reveal market saturation and opportunities for new listings.

## 📁 Files

- `AirBnB Project.twb` – Main Tableau workbook containing the dashboard(s) and visualizations.

## 🗂️ Data Sources

The dataset used in this project includes information such as:

- Listing ID
- Host ID and name
- Room type (Entire home/apt, Private room, Shared room)
- Price
- Number of minimum nights
- Number of reviews
- Availability (number of days)
- Location (latitude, longitude, neighborhood)

> The data is typically sourced from the Inside Airbnb website (http://insideairbnb.com/) or Kaggle datasets.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Tableau Public** – For creating visual dashboards and exploring patterns.
- **Excel / CSV** – For preprocessing the raw dataset before import into Tableau.
- **GitHub** – For project versioning and collaboration.

## 📈 Visualizations

The workbook contains interactive dashboards including:

1. **Price Analysis Dashboard**
   - Average price by room type and neighborhood
   - Price distribution histograms

2. **Host Activity Dashboard**
   - Top hosts by number of listings
   - Review count trends

3. **Availability & Demand Dashboard**
   - Availability calendar heatmaps
   - Booking frequency

4. **Geographical Analysis**
   - Map view of listings with filters for price, room type, and availability

## ✅ Key Insights (Sample – Customize Based on Actual Dashboard)

- Entire homes command significantly higher prices, especially in downtown areas.
- Most hosts have only one or two listings.
- High-review listings are generally more competitively priced.
- There is seasonal variation in price and availability.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Download the `.twb` file and open in Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public.
2. Make sure your data source is connected (or modify to match your local dataset).
3. Interact with filters and dashboards to explore trends.

## 📌 Notes

- This is an exploratory project and is intended for educational purposes.
- The workbook does not store the data itself—only references to external sources or extracted versions.
- Make sure to update the data connection if you're using a new or local dataset.
